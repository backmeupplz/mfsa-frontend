        Congratulations! Now you have everything you needed to start casting. I
        would ask you <b>not</b> to share the API key with anyone (otherwise
        I'll have to shut down the API) and carefuly use it. Also consider
        following <Link url="https://warpcast.com/borodutch">@borodutch</Link>.
        Cheers!
